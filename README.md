This is a game I have been working on in my free time. I did most of the work in the Spring Semester of my Sophomore year of college. The objective of the game is to take the opponents bases until your faction is the last one remaining. 

The game starts at the title screen: ![Base-destroyers title screen ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/164af948-71f5-4f2b-ba27-1adfd7d8e523)

Then the main menu screen opens: ![Base-destroyers main menu screen ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1f47b6e-e0f4-445d-be23-5fa0a6c2291b)
Here you pick your game type. When starting this project, I wanted to have a story mode and a custom mode and a free play mode. I have not yet implemented the story mode and the I currently have the custom and free play mode combined. When you click on custom, the game screen opens.

The game screen: ![Base-destroyers Game screen ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e3a950-a6c7-4dee-970b-16f9bdddd55e)
The player is the blue faction and the goal of the game is to destroy all the other factions, (excluding gray, the neutral faction). By clicking on a blue base to select it, you can then click on any other base to attack if you do not own it or to reinforce it if you do own it. 

The game may look something like this about halfway through: ![Base-destroyers Game screen midgame ss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/016ed8bd-3216-40df-9148-b06ba8169f33)

The game ends when all bases are under control of a single faction. At the end of the game, a button will appear to allow the game to restart. The number of wins for each faction is tracked at the bottom of the screen.
